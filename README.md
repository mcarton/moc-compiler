moc-compiler
============

A school project to create a compiler for an objective-Câ€”like language

It uses [egg](https://github.com/arthaud/egg) as a parser generator.

It can be used to compile a sort of objective-C like language into the Triangle Abstract Machine (TAM) assembly language or the LLVM IR code.

This was a school project (we are student at [ENSEEIHT](http://enseeiht.fr/)) but we have greatly expanded it. The LLVM part was not part of the subject.
